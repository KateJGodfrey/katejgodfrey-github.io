I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota with interests in precision (highly accurate and reliable) functional brain imaging using fMRI and statistics. My current work aims to develop methods for understaning principals of adolescent functional brain organization and consequences of functional brain organization for behavior.
